a0 ~ a7 contains arguments. For example, a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf, and a1 holds 12 = f(8) + 1.

There is no call to function f or g, since these functions are inlined, which leads to a constant value f(8) + 1 = 12.

1554(ra) = 0x30 + 0x612 (= 1554) = 1602 = 0x642.

The code outputs He110 World. 57616 = 0x110, and since RISC-V is little-endian, the output bytes for \%s are [0x72, 0x6c, 0x64, 0x00 = '\textbackslash0'], which denotes "rld". If RISC-V is big-endian, i should be changed to 0x726c6400, and 57616 should stay unchanged.

y should be the value of register a2.
